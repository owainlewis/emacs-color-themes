# Emacs themes

Emacs interpretations of the brilliant ST2 colour themes by Dayle Rees adapted slightly for Emacs.

All the themes are named after personal programming and tech heroes.

## Use

Just copy the themes and require them.

Running install.sh will put the themes in  ~/.emacs.d/themes

To load a theme add the following to your init.el

```elisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes")
(load-theme 'hickey t)
```

One line install script

```
git clone https://github.com/owainlewis/emacs-color-themes.git && cd emacs-color-themes && ./install.sh
```
